- No user function
- No lifting the given observables

The entire process becomes simpler

- Time series and noise can dump the additional 1 column of observation

- Create the observation matrix
- Time series and noise:
----> Observe via the above
----> Delay the time series and the noise

- Update matcarve fun to work with the input matrix as an argument
- noisygetcquad
- Update the trueval business


- No updating the trueval means a greater shortening of the code !









 <------- Det and Stoch in one code ------------->
 
 - ics containing both data and noise
 - Big IF / a flavour  that separates both approaches
